**Problem Statement**

The prevalence of fake reviews in cyberspace has become a major concern for both consumers and businesses
alike. With the continuous evolution of online reviews, they have become a crucial determinant of business
success in various sectors such as restaurants, hotels, and e-commerce. A positive review can attract more
customers and lead to a significant increase in sales. However, some businesses are resorting to unethical
practices such as using fake reviews of their competitors to improve their online reputation, which can mislead
customers and damage the credibility of the review system. As a result, detecting fake reviews has become a
challenging and constantly evolving research area. It is essential to develop effective methods to identify and
prevent fake reviews to ensure the integrity of online review systems and maintain consumer trust.

**Objectives:**

*Provide evidence that ensemble models are capable of better fake review detection compared to
conventional approaches, even when dealing with vast datasets.

*Illustrate that ensemble methods are a more effective technique for detecting fake reviews compared
to other methods like sentiment analysis and supervised learning algorithms.

*Verify the difference between the performance of supervised learning methods and ensemble
methods in detecting fake reviews.

*Employ techniques such as data resampling, feature pruning, and parameter optimization to enhance
the performance of ensemble models.
